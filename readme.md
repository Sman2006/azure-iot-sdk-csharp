# Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET

This repository contains the following:
* **Microsoft Azure IoT Hub device SDK for C#** to connect client devices to Azure IoT Hub with .NET
* **Microsoft Azure IoT Hub service SDK for C#** to manage your IoT Hub service instance from a back-end .NET application

The API reference documentation for .NET SDK is [here](dotnet-api-reference).

To find SDKs in other languages for Azure IoT, please refer to the [azure-iot-sdks][azure-iot-sdks] repository.

## Developing applications for Azure IoT
Visit [Azure IoT Dev Center][iot-dev-center] to learn more about developing applications for Azure IoT.

## How to use the Azure IoT SDKs for .NET

* **Using packages and libraries**: The simplest way to use the Azure IoT SDKs is to use packages and libraries when available. Refer to [this document](./device/doc/devbox_setup.md) on how to get Azure IoT SDKs for .NET using Nuget and build applications.
* **Clone the repository**: The repository is using [GitHub Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for its dependencies. In order to automatically clone these submodules, you need to use the --recursive option as described here:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp.git
```

## Contribution, feedback and issues

If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions for new features or if you would like to become an active contributor to this project please follow the instructions provided in the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For suggestions regarding the Azure IoT Services, please use https://feedback.azure.com/forums/321918-azure-iot

## Support

If you are having issues using one of the packages or using the Azure IoT Hub service that go beyond simple bug fixes or help requests that would be dealt within the issues section of this project, the Microsoft Customer Support team will try and help out on a best effort basis.
To engage Microsoft support, you can create a support ticket directly from the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).
Escalated support requests for Azure IoT Hub SDKs development questions will only be available Monday thru Friday during normal coverage hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST.
Here is what you can expect Microsoft Support to be able to help with:
- **SDKs issues**: If you are trying to compile and run the libraries on a supported platform, the Support team will be able to assist with troubleshooting or questions related to compiler issues and communications to and from the IoT Hub.  They will also try to assist with questions related to porting to an unsupported platform, but will be limited in how much assistance can be provided.  The team will be limited with trouble-shooting the hardware device itself or drivers and or specific properties on that device. 
- **IoT Hub / Connectivity Issues**: Communication from the device client to the Azure IoT Hub service and communication from the Azure IoT Hub service to the client.  Or any other issues specifically related to the Azure IoT Hub.
- **Portal Issues**: Issues related to the portal, that includes access, security, dashboard, devices, Alarms, Usage, Settings and Actions.
- **REST/API Issues**: Using the IoT Hub REST/APIs that are documented in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/iothub/).

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes (crashes, memory leaks, etc.)

No new features or improvements will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.

## Schedule<sup>1</sup>

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released

| Nuget Package | Github Branch | LTS Status | LTS Start Date | Maintenance End Date | Removed Date |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :------------: | :------------------: | :----------: |
| Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client v1.5.1, Microsoft.Azure.Devices v1.4.0, Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared v1.1.1 | lts_07_2017   | Active     | 2017-07-01     | 2017-12-31           | 2018-06-30   |

* <sup>1</sup> All scheduled dates are subject to change by the Azure IoT SDK team.
